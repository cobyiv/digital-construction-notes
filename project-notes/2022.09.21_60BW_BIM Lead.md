#### Feedback for Tori & Liz

- **TW & LP** - Prior to meeting be clear about who is going to broach each subject and will get confirmation on specific items.
- **TW**, try not to over distinguish DCT vs. Dowbuilt. I think it's more straightforward to call us 'Dowbuilt' to external entities
- **LP**, try to appeal to the utility of software not by the amount of burden it places on us, but rather the value/utility to the project team. So avoid saying, Navisworks is not our preference because it takes a lot of work on our end and more, BIM Collaborate Pro platform is a great conflict resolution process for the entire project because it will reduce paperwork for everyone.
- **LP **-- Feel free to jump into conversation more so!
- **TW** -- Towards the end of a meeting Get Clarity and confirmation in Meeting on agenda items. <u>example:</u> So it sounds like the team is in alignment on the BIM Collaborate Clash Detection system so we will get started on that.
- **TW** -- we don't necessarily want to take over there models. So angle towards them staying on the project as long as possible.
- **TW** -- Itemize all requests and direct at entities in clear concise list.
